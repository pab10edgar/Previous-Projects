<h2>GUI Layout Practice</h2>

A GUI with two panels that contains a 3D cube moveable with keyboard arrows on the left side, and a counter/button on the other side.  

• A large panel on which a custom image is painted.<br>
• A button that triggers a dialog to be displayed. The dialog should display a message
  informing the user of how many times the button was clicked.<br>
• A label that displays how many times the button was clicked.
